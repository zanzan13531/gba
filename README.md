Two options for playing stuff:

Easier option: 
go to https://zanzan13531.github.io/gba/ and click on a game and wait for it to load
(saves might work? not really sure)

Harder option: 
1. download this repository as a zip file and extract it
2. go to https://taisel.github.io/IodineGBA/
3. under file -> bios, put in the gba_bios.bin file found the binaries folder
4. under file -> game, pick a game (name.gba)
5. saves need to be done in game and in the iodine interface both i think, i never really tested it (not confirmed if saves work but they probably should)
